#
# To install the Acoustics Toolbox:
#
# 1) Uncomment the appropriate lines below to select your FORTRAN compiler
#    (also be sure to comment out all of the lines corresponding to the other compilers).

# 2) If you're using gfortran check the -march switch that selects the chip you're using.
#    Usually -march=native works

# 3) From a command line shell, run:
#    % make clean
#    % make

# on some machines you need to say -mcmodel=medium (or large) to allow for variables larger than 2 gig

# *** Windows ***
# If you don't have a FORTRAN compiler, the MinGW ("Minimalist GNU for Windows") compiler suite
# is a good choice as it is much easier to install than Cygwin. See http://www.mingw.org/ for details.
# Not sure if this is still necessary, but we used to have to change the options -O3 to -O2 below when using gfortran

# *** Linux ***
# Most Linux distributions have gfortran already packaged and it can be installed with the respective 
# package manager (e.g. apt-get, dnf, yum). The packaged versions of the LAPACK library are generally
# compatible with Krakel. If you want statically linked executables, "-static" works with gfortran.

# *** Mac ***
# The option to create an executable that uses a static library has been a problem.
# The gcc community seems to feel that dynamic vs. static libraries is an issue of religious importance.
# I prefer static libraries because users have a lot fewer problems installing the code when they don't have
# to worry about getting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH set, or the fact that some programs (e.g. Matlab) may reset
# that path to an incompatible version.
# -static is supposed to work if gfortran has been compiled to enable that option.
# However, crt0.o comes up as misssing
# -Bstatic worked

# The make utility tends to get confused with modules because it does not necessarily update the *.mod file
# when it compiles the *.f90 file. (The *.mod file contains interface information that doesn't necessarily change
# even then the *.f90 file has changed.)
# As a result, you may find that make keeps compiling a module, that was already compiled.
# A 'make clean' will fix that

# *** ifort
# These lines are used under Mac OSX; the syntax is different under Windows
# !!!!!!! You also need to use xiar instead of ar
# That change needs to be made in at/misc/Makefile and at/tslib/Makefile
# Note that the -assume byterecl is important, otherwise the output files have the wrong format

# If you use the -parallel option, the compiler links into a dynamic library for OpenMP
# Then you need to make sure that dylib is in the path

# Choose the best architecture (target machine) using the -x switch
# According to the latest benchmarks on polyhedron, it looks like -parallel is very helpful

# *** GNU Compiler Collection GFORTRAN

# use -march=generic if you get warning messages about instructions that don't make sense
# -march=generic assumes an old Intel architecture that the newer versions can all execute (slowly)
# -march=native should normally be the best; however, it produced AVX instructions on the Mac that the default assembler could not process
# -O2 was the highest level of optimization that worked under Windows

# -static can be used to tell gfortran not to rely on a dynamic link library (the compiler may or may not support)
# -static does not seem to work on Macs though, and produces larger executables

# Have had various problems where some installed dynamic link library is incompatible with the one the compiler used and expects at run time
# For instance, Matlab changes paths and may point to an incompatible library.
# One user found that it was necessary to delete /usr/local/gfortran/lib/libquadmath.dylib to force a static link. See:
# http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17590525/correct-way-to-statically-link-in-gfortran-libraries-on-osx
#
# The -Wa,-q flag can be used to select the Mac CLANG assembler instead of the GNU assembler
# At one time that was necessary to get the AVX operations; however, I saw no speed benefit
# -march=corei7-avx works on my Mac
